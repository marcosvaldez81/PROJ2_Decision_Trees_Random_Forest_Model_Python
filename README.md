# PROJ2_Decision_Trees_Random_Forest_Model_Python

This model classifies Kyphosis disease. I utilize these features within the dataset: 
  - Age: in months
  - Number: the number of vertebrae involved
  - Start: the number of the first (topmost) vertebra operated on 


Used Libraries:

  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib.pyplot
  - from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  - from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
  - from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
  - from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  
  Please make sure you download the CSV file and have it in same root as the jupyter notebook in order for it to work.
